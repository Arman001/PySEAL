**PySEAL**

This is for Python3

In order to install and use the python wrapper to SEAL, run the following bash script

1. cd to scripts and run "bash build-libs.sh" to build the library. 
2. cd to SEALPython
3. Run "python  matrix_operations.py" to execute an example of some matrix operations using SEAL.

Now you can also run a notebook in there to play around with PySEAL.
